#FAQ

## Issues

### Can't save a password
* Is folder initialised? Easiest way is to use the [Users] button and make sure you can encrypt for someone (eg. yourself)
* Are you using git? If not, make sure it is switched off.

### I have an issue with GNOME keyring
* Disable GNOME keyring
* Create a `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` containing:
```
enable-ssh-support
write-env-file
use-standard-socket
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
```

Also, the following is useful to add to your .bashrc if you are using Yubikey NEO on Ubuntu:

```
# OpenPGP applet support for YubiKey NEO
if [ ! -f /tmp/gpg-agent.env ]; then
    killall gpg-agent;
        eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support > /tmp/gpg-agent.env);
fi
. /tmp/gpg-agent.env
```
